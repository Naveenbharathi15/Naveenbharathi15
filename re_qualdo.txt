08. From Beginning to Ending
09. Some Screenshoots of RE project?
10. what are the problems RE facing?
-- Repeated corrections from RE even after finalising Piperr reports visual dbs

11. For example if RE has some data drift. we need to show that we are helping them identifing the data drift in qualdo.
we have prediction algorithms, which will reflect the forecast of next three months, where we can analyse variation in data behaviour 

12. If there is a usecase on fillrate we have to explain usecase.
